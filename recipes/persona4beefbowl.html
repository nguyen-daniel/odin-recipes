      The famous beef bowl from the Yasogami High School Diner in Persona 4.
    </p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>2 Cups Water</li>
      <li>2 tsp. Dashi Powder</li>
      <li>1 Tbsp. Aji-Mirin Sweet Cooking Rice Seasoning</li>
      <li>1 Tbsp. Sugar</li>
      <li>2 Tbsp. Soy Sauce</li>
      <li>1 tsp. Worcestershire Sauce (optional)</li>
      <li>1/2 tsp. Fresh Ginger (optional)</li>
      <li>1/2 tsp. Minced Garlic (optional)</li>
      <li>2 Onions, sliced</li>
      <li>As much thinly sliced steak as possible</li>
      <li>2 tsp. Cornstarch</li>
      <li>Fluffy White Rice</li>
      <li>Small Egg, poached</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        In a large pot bring the 2 cups of water to a boil & add the dashi
        powder. Stir until dissolved & then add the mirin, sugar, soy sauce,
        onion slices, & optional Worcestershire, ginger, & garlic (I love it
        with these flavors!). Stir & continue to boil gently until the onions
        are caramelized. Reduce heat to medium.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add the thinly sliced steak to the onions & sauce. Push the meat into
        the sauce & turn over occasionally to cook fully (this will only take a
        few minutes). Break the meat apart with your spoon (or two forks) & mix
        well with the onions & sauce.
      </li>
      <li>
        Once the meat is cooked & incorporated, remove the meat & onions from
        the sauce into a large bowl using a slotted spoon or tongs. Leave the
        sauce in the pot. Using a measuring cup (or other small cup) scoop out a
        small amount of sauce & dissolve the cornstarch into it. Pour the
        cornstarch mixture into the pot & stir. Bring the sauce back to a boil &
        let it cook until it thickens. Reduce the heat to a low simmer to let it
        thicken more.
      </li>
      <li>
        At this point you can put the onions & meat back into the pot with the
        sauce or pour the sauce into the bowl with the onions & meat. Serve
        mounded on top of fluffy rice with the poached egg added last (or not at
        all). And have confidence that you can finish it! Understanding!
        Knowledge! Courage! Diligence!
